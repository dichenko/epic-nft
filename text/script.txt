Stein, 84A1900,

report to "B"block.

F***.

Come on, Stein, move your ass.

And don't forget your stinking rat.

His name's Tony Curtis

to you, scumbag.

Watch your mouth, convict.

Youse will be back.

Not in this lifetime.

Take care. All right.

Look up Batches for me, man.

You take care.

Baby!

Welcome to the free world, man.

Welcome back.

- What's this?

- You know.

Bullet, come on,

save it for the car.

Here. These are your favorite.

- How are you doing, big guy?

- l'm doing great.

Check it out. What do you think?

Not bad, huh?

Let's go get high.

lt's on the state.

Now you're talking.

Ruby, there's those

two faggots from the island.

l bet you they're going to cop.

Am l missing something here?

Every time me and Ruby come here,

we see these two punks.

Your girlfriend Tank's

making a fortune off them.

You got a piece, Lester?

Yeah...

Absolutely.

What are you going to do with that?

Just shut the f*** up, Ruby.

Stop being such a dick.

Oh, man.

Ruby, you stay in the car.

Lester, come on.

What do youse need?

Where's Flaco?

Flaco had to take care

of some business.

Who the f*** are you?

Listen, punk,

you looking to cop something,

or you want to just stay here

in your mama's Jaguar?

Just chill out.

lt's all right.

Don't you tell me to chill out.

Come on.

- Just get up against the wall!

- What the f*** is this?

lt's your life!

Now shut your mouth!

Don't hurt us.

l can get anything you want.

My parents got

a shitload of money!

Punk, what we want,

money can't buy.

Take off your clothes.

What?

Are we going to rob them

or f*** them?

What difference does it make?

Sh*t.

What are you doing up here?

l told you to stay in the car.

F***ing crazy.

You just got out of jail, man.

Come on, Butch.

Get the hell out of here.

Ruby, stop being such a p*ssy

and wait in the car.

Lester, don't call my brother a p*ssy.

Don't ever say that to him again.

Getting high is one thing.

Ripping people off is another.

Man, there's no way

l'm upping the booty.

You're going to have to kill me.

You're real brave, huh?

l like that in a woman.

Now, you got about ten seconds

to take off your panties.

F***, Jamie, just do it, man!

Let's go, girls.

Give me that.

F***, man!

l can't f***ing believe

he did that!

Shut up, Brian.

You're such a f***ing p*ssy!

Motherf***er. Thought you was upstate,

you motherf***er.

l was. Now l'm downtown, Flaco.

You got a problem with that?

l hope you Jew clowns

ain't up to what l think you're up to.

Flaco, don't tell me that an educated spic

like yourself is an anti-Semite.

F*** him, Bullet.

Come on.

There's your f***ing spic,

you cocksucker.

Get the f*** out of here!

Come on, Butch! Please.

Get in the car!

Tell that n*gger Tank...

Bullet's back.

Come on!

You out of your f***ing mind?

Jesus Christ.

Tank's going to go ape sh*t.

l know.

Son of a b*tch!

Go away!

l ain't buying nothing!

Let us just use your phone!

We've been mugged!

Look at this.

We don't need your kind

down here buying drugs.

Why don't you go back

to where you came from?

Why don't you go back

to where you came from?

Come on, lady, please.

We'll pay you whatever you want.

What are you going to pay me with--

that tiny thing between your legs?

What are you going to pay me with--

that tiny thing between your legs?

Move your f***ing asses out of

this building before l blow your balls off!

l better not catch you

back here again!

Sh*t, man, she's crazy, too!

Bullet, take it easy

with that sh*t, will you?

Two bags of it will have you

sucking your own dick.

He's right.
Let's just have a little taste.

l'll bang up more

than both you put together.

Fire this up.

Sh*t.

Lester. Lester, wake up.

Wake up, man.

- You're burning a hole in your chest.

- F***. F***!

l'm never, ever gonna stop

Not the way

l feel about you

Girl, l just can't live

without you

l'm never, ever

gonna quit 'cause

Quittin' just ain't my shtick

l'm gonna stay

right here with you

How you doing, honey?

- How you doing, baby?

- Want to party?

Listen, guys, l got to take care

of some business here.

Someone's getting it

in the ass hard.

How you doing?

Stupid-ass.

- You're so stupid--

- Go f*** yourself.

You got the sweetest ass.

You got the sweetest ass.

You better straighten up

because Mom's home.

Dad's there.

He's going to start in with his sh*t

soon as l walk in the door.

Just take it easy.

So, Butch,

what are you going to do?

What plans have you made?

Just looking around.

You're looking around?

Sol, please,

tell Butchy about the job.

l got a building going up

in Williamsburg.

l can get you on the crew.

lt's up to $9 an hour.

l already got you on the payroll,

take care of your parole situation.

You'll come with me

in the morning.

l got some people l'm going to see

about some other kind of work.

Oh, yeah, Butch?

What kind of work is that?

Sol, please.

You're 35 goddamn years old!

When are you going to start

taking responsibility for your life?

You f***ed up all those

baseball scholarships.

You could have made

something of yourself.

But you're weak,

you goddamn loser.

- Sol, please--

- Cookie, shut up.

You boys--

the three of youse--you're killing me.

Just chill out.

lt's his first night back.

Oh, listen.

Mr. Big Shot--sleeps all day,

runs around all night

with that fag Lester--

Lester's not a fag.
- Cookie, give me another martini.

- Yeah, Mom, make it a double.

Listen, schmuck,

nobody's talking to you.

Your brother's got an excuse--

he's a convict.

Your goddamn genius brother

over here thinks he's--

What the hell's that guy's name?

Salvatore Dali.

Pop, it's Salvador.

Salvador, Salvatore,

what the hell's the difference?

l break my ass to give you boys

all the opportunities l never had.

What do l get back in return?

A convict, a schmuck,

and a schizophrenic psychotic...

who thinks he's a G.l. Joe.

Michelangelo's old man considered art

a profession of social disgrace.

A lot of his art

is a projection of his own

emotional pain at home.

l think l can relate with that.

Don't break my balls.

Listen, Pop, there's worse things

than prison--your mind.

Yeah, right.

All three of you should be in jail,

where you don't have to work

for a living.

l don't think so.

You try watching some young cherry

from the neighborhood

getting his a**hole reamed out

by a bunch of murderers and rapists.

You look at that.

lt don't matter how bad

you think you are.

lf these motherfuckers want you,

they're going to take you.

You try living with that.

Welcome home, convict.

You're a very touching story.

My hemorrhoids bleed for you.

Pop...now, why can't you

find me a job?

l think it's really funny

that the horrible convict over here

ain't out of jail for 24 hours

and you managed

to find him a f***ing job.

Louis, are you going

to have dinner tonight?

What ever happened

to death before dishonor?

Louis, don't start.

Come, put your teeth in

and have some kasha varnishkes.

Ma, l don't know

where my teeth are.

Pop, are you wearing my teeth?

Can't you just feel

the love in this room?

What?

l'm in no mood

for your sh*t tonight.

Do yourself a favor--

go back to your room.

l'm going back to my room,

and l'm going to make sure

that you do not enter it.

Louis, please change your underwears.

They're filthy.

l don't want to change

my underwear.

l won't be living here much longer, Ma.

l'm leaving the country.

l've signed up with an elite

Special Forces unit.

Don't ask me any information, see,

because even if l were to get caught,

l wouldn't tell them sh*t.

l see the shrinks

are making progress.

Kid, what up?

You're looking good.

Amigo, your ride's here.

- Don't give me any more of this.

- l'm not going to give you--

l don't need this aggravation.

Do you understand?

What up, Tank?

How you doing, man?

Don't give me that ''what up'' sh*t.

l hope you wasn't down

with that bagel-eating motherf***er.

What are you talking about?

Bullet just got out

of the penitentiary.

- Yeah, so?

- So?

He robbed two of my best customers,

stuck my man Flaco in the eye,

and took off

with my product and my cash, so!

Tank, no sh*t, this is

the first l heard of this.

Honestly.

l should have murdered that motherf***er

three years ago while we was up north.

Listen, Tank, what the f***

you want from us, anyway?

What do l want?

l want you to find the motherf***er

and bring him to me!

Would you stop?

l'll find out what happened.

You do that, Paddy.

You do that, because if you don't,

me and you going to have problems.

You understand?

Why you got to jump

all over me like this?

Why can't you chill out?

l'll find out what happened.

You got my cash?

Yeah, l got your cash.

lt's all there--24 large.

Jesus Christ.

What's the matter,

you don't trust me anymore?

l don't trust no-motherfucking-body.

Until this sh*t is over

and l got

that motherf***er's head

on a platter, you cut off.
This is bullshit.

You want to do something

about it, little man?

Chill.

Paddy, you tell Bullet l said

the only bullet he's going to see

is the one l'm going to put

in his f***ing ass.

You got that?

- Yeah, l got it.

- Good.

Y'all get up from around me.

Y'all stinking up my car.

Smell like wet dogs

in this motherf***er.

Get out of here!

Top of the morning, fellas.

Let's go.

Suck my dick, you stupid n*gger.

F*** you! F*** you!

F***ing white boys, man.

What the f*** are we doing

in this spic joint?

Come on, man, look around.

Here, take a Spanish fly.

Excuse me.

Would you like to dance?

l like the way you move.

You look...

You look, like, really,

really hard, you know?.

Looks are deceiving.

l mean, come on,

you don't dance?

We could dance.

Why don't you dance?

l'll watch you.

Man, why don't you

loosen up a little, man?

Sit down.

Can't you enjoy yourself?

What's up, bro?

You got ability.

You could do something with this.

Get your head screwed on right,

you could make some money,

get away from all this bullshit.

Listen, l do what l do.

There ain't nothin' else to it.

You ever heard

of Pablo Picasso?

Yeah, l heard of him.

Picasso said that art

is the ultimate perpetration of fraud.

What he really meant was

this is all bullshit.

See, a piece of paper

or the canvas and the paint,

it all costs a few bucks.

The finished product

goes for a million dollars!

What the f***'s wrong

with a million dollars?

Nothing's wrong with it.

The thing is,

is that all it means

is something

is wrong with the system.

l'll tell you something--people love

controlling other people, all right?

Bro, we're only here

for a cup of coffee.

You got to take care

of what you believe in.

Eight years l ain't busted a nut.

That spic broad over there--
l'm going to give it to her good tonight.

Don't worry about it.

lt happens to everybody.

You know?.

l like to be here with you anyway.

l can jerk it.

l can whack it.

l could smack it.

lt just don't work.

lt's dead.

lt's okay.

lt doesn't matter.

lt's okay.

lt doesn't matter.

- lt doesn't matter, okay?

- Yeah, whatever.

- l got to go, okay?

- Sure, baby, you go.

This is the not-to-be-missed story

of how air power helped win...

By September the 10th...

Close the f***ing door!

Are you nuts?

Tell me about this little journey

you're about to take.

Sorry, brother.

That's confidential information.

- You talk to anybody about this?

- No!

But l will tell you this

because l trust you.

l am going to gather--

Ten-hut! Sit!

l am going to gather an army

of invisible warriors.

This time, l will have experienced,

well-trained troops.

Military force

is not constant at--f***.

Victory in war

is not repetitious.

lt is constantly changing form.

l don't expect a civilian like you

to understand what l'm talking about...

But you know that.

Whatever form my enemy has,

me and my unit will kick

the living sh*t out of them

and attain total victory.

l love you.

Chagall...

There ain't no such thing

as lovers Over the Town,

not in this family, anyway, all right?

You got Butchy

to thank for that.

You're too young to remember,

but he robbed everybody

in this household.

He even stole your little piggy bank

for a couple lousy bags of dope.

F*** him.

Let him live someplace else.

Nobody wants him here.

Where is he going to go?

He's got no place else to go.

War is war!

lt ain't f***ing Monopoly!

l had simpleminded, pimple-faced,

inexperienced recruits

not much older than you guys.

Two thousand years ago,

Sun Tzu,
an ancient Chinese warrior,

left behind secret documents

on the art of war.

l happen to be in possession

of those documents.

- Can we see them?

- No, you cannot see them!

- You have to earn that right, private.

- Yes, sir.

Get your mama's titty out

of your mouth and talk, soldier!

Yes, sir!

Goddamn it!

God-f***ing-damn it!

You needle-d*cks don't know

what l'm talking about!

You ain't never been surrounded

by North Vietnamese regulars.

Seventh Cav, baby--

we was the best.

Now, that was a war!

l get a big pink boner

every time l think about that.

None of that limp-dick, Desert Storm,

puppy-sh*t, smart-weapons bullshit.

No, you're the only smart weapon.

Stanley, you're the smart weapon.

l want you to demonstrate

what we did last week.

Philly, up against the car.

Here you go.

Go ahead, Stanley.

Okay, first you jab

the knife in the throat.

When you feel you've hit the spine,

rip the blade to the right.

Make sure to cut

the two coronary arteries.

Good. That's good.

- Good job, Stanley.

- Thank you.

All right, Stanley.

Too sexy for my car,

too sexy by far

And l'm too sexy for my hat

Catwalk,

on the catwalk

Come on!

Jesus Christ.

Nice sled, Lester.

Looks like a f***ing

Hostess Sno Ball.

Just get in.

My mother's on vacation in Florida.

What's this garbage?

Sounds like a chipmunk with diarrhea.

l like that.

What are you doing?

Cost me $10.95 plus tax.

You call that music?

This is music.

Bro, how come Paddy

not making the drop, man?

He's a f***ing punk--

will not take orders.

- You got a problem with that, Rico?

- l got no problem.

Watch out.

Boy!

- Come see me, man!

- All right, man.

You do what l ask?

Yeah, l called that f***ing Lester.

l told him we got a smoker.

Believe me, he'll be here.

Don't worry about it.
Look, give this to Pruitt.

When Bullet shows up,

make sure he gets that bundle.

lt's got a red rubber band around it

so you don't get confused.

lt's got a red rubber band around it

so you don't get confused.

Think you can handle that?

Yeah, man.

Some kind of problem, man?

Don't worry about that.

That's my business.

Now take this sh*t

and get away from my car.

Come on!

What's up?

Mazel Tuff! Where the hell

do you think you're going?

Get your ass back up that ladder

and finish the job!

Tom Thumb, listen,

go follow the Yellow Brick Road.

Screw you, wise-ass.

F***er!

F*** you, wise-ass!

Motherf***er!

l'll see you in hell!

You guys wait here.

l'm going to go in alone.

F*** that sh*t.

l'm going in with you.

Hurry up.

This f***ing place gives me the creeps.

Ruby, you stay in the car.

And it's smoking, motherfuckers.

We got the toilet.

Get back down here in line, man.

Get back in line.

Man, what you doing out?

What are you doing out?

- l thought you were at the state, man.

- l'm a free man, Willy.

How you doing, bro?

Uptown? Downtown?

What's going on, Willy?

Yeah, it's the white dude

with the black hood.

Yeah, and the sweatpants.

He just walked in, okay?

You know l'm going to

get the money, right?

Bullet. What's up, man?

Got some cash?

- How you been?

- Good.

All right, all right.

Over against the wall.

He's okay. Let him in, man.

lt's all right.

Come on, hurry up.

Give me a bag of boy,

a bag of girl.

Everybody on the ground! Now!

What the hell is going on?

Shoot her!

Here he is!

Give it up, Bullet.

Let's move it!

Just give him the f***ing dope!

- Give it to him!

- Come on!

Get out of here!

Stay down, motherf***er!

Don't move!

Let's go! Let's go!

Look out, man!

Look out!

Oh, sh*t!

- Motherf***er!
- Oh, sh*t!

Want to play?

Oh, my God!

My mother's f***ing car!

Oh, sh*t.

Motherf***er.

My drawing hand!

Man, without this, l ain't got nothing!

l ain't got f***ing nothing!

l know that.

l'm going to pull it out.

Take a deep breath.

You're all right.

Come on.

Wake up!

What up, Bernard?

Same old sh*t, Paddy.

lt's hanging, swinging.

Just give me the cash.

You don't look too good.

What's going on?

You going to be sick?

How much we got?

What are you doing?

You feeding my money to the roaches?

Get this f***ing thing out of there.

We got a dead one over here.

What the f*** is this sh*t?

What are you doing?

l just thought he was enjoying himself.

Look at this piece of sh*t--

he's as blue as Elvis.

He f***ing stinks.

Get him out of here.

Give me a hand.

Must have sh*t yourself.

What's up, Paddy?

That guy, he must have done something

to really piss off Tank.

That guy, he must have done something

to really piss off Tank.

- Mama, look.

- Mind your own business.

Stay close to me.

You want some of this?

l don't stick nothing up my nose

unless its legs

are wrapped around my neck.

Good. That's more for me.

Listen, l got another

job for us tonight.

Yeah? What kind of job?

l heard my ma talking

to the neighbor next door.

They're going down to Miami

for a couple of months.

They're rich.

Place is a gold mine.

ln and out in five seconds.

lt's a piece of cake.

Jesus Christ.

Your f***ing neighbors?

That's cold.

F*** them, man.

l never liked them anyway.

You know,

you've got a serious problem.

Are you going to wear that sweater?

The black sweater--

you going to wear it tonight?

Why?

l want to wear it.

Goes with my black pants. Do you mind?

What are you worrying about

what you're going to wear?

We're going to rob a house.
